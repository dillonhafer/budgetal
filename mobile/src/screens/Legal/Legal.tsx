                PREAMBLE The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to
                stimulate worldwide development of collaborative font projects,
                to support the font creation efforts of academic and linguistic
                communities, and to provide a free and open framework in which
                fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others.
              </Number>

              <Number>
                The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified
                and redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by
                themselves. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be
                bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or sold with any software
                provided that any reserved names are not used by derivative
                works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released
                under any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to
                remain under this license does not apply to any document created
                using the fonts or their derivatives.
              </Number>

              <Number>
                DEFINITIONS "Font Software" refers to the set of files released
                by the Copyright Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked
                as such. This may include source files, build scripts and
                documentation.
              </Number>

              <Number>
                "Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after
                the copyright statement(s).
              </Number>

              <Number>
                "Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software
                components as distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).
              </Number>

              <Number>
                "Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to,
                deleting, or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the
                components of the Original Version, by changing formats or by
                porting the Font Software to a new environment.
              </Number>

              <Number>
                "Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
                writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.
              </Number>

              <Number>
                PERMISSION & CONDITIONS Permission is hereby granted, free of
                charge, to any person obtaining a copy of the Font Software, to
                use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify, redistribute, and sell
                modified and unmodified copies of the Font Software, subject to
                the following conditions:
              </Number>

              <Number>
                1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual
                components, in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by
                itself.
              </Number>
              <Number>
                2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be
                bundled, redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided
                that each copy contains the above copyright notice and this
                license. These can be included either as stand-alone text files,
                human-readable headers or in the appropriate machine-readable
                metadata fields within text or binary files as long as those
                fields can be easily viewed by the user.
              </Number>
              <Number>
                3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved
                Font Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by
                the corresponding Copyright Holder. This restriction only
                applies to the primary font name as presented to the users.
              </Number>

              <Number>
                4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of
                the Font Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or
                advertise any Modified Version, except to acknowledge the
                contribution(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or
                with their explicit written permission.
              </Number>

              <Number>
                5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in
                whole, must be distributed entirely under this license, and must
                not be distributed under any other license. The requirement for
                fonts to remain under this license does not apply to any
                document created using the Font Software.
              </Number>

              <Number>
                TERMINATION This license becomes null and void if any of the
                above conditions are not met.
              </Number>
